Oxylabsâ€™ [Classifieds Scraper](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/web/classifieds-scraper?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repositories&utm_campaign=product) is a data gathering solution allowing you to extract real-time information from any Classifieds website effortlessly. This brief guide explains how a Classifieds Scraper works and provides code examples to understand better how you can use it hassle-free.

### How it works

You can get Classifieds results by providing your own URLs to our service. We can return the HTML for any Classifieds page you like.

#### Python code example

The example below illustrates how you can obtain Craigslist classifieds HTML results.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal',
    'url': 'https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/ata#search=1~gallery~0~0'
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('user', 'pass1'),
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with the result.
pprint(response.json())
```
